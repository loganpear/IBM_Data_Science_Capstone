# SpaceX Rocket Reuse Prediction Project 

This capstone project, part of the IBM Data Science course on Coursera, was instructed by IBM and completed independently. I utilized AI tools such as ChatGPT for coding efficiency and Microsoft's PowerPoint Designer for slideshow formatting.


## Overview

SpaceX leads the commercial space industry by making space travel more affordable, thanks to its reusable Falcon 9 rockets. Priced at $62 million per launch, significantly less than competitors, SpaceXâ€™s cost savings come from reusing the first stage. This project involves predicting the likelihood of SpaceX reusing the first stage, using machine learning and public data, simulating the role of a data scientist by covering:

- Data collection
- Wrangling
- Exploratory analysis
- Visualization
- Model development
- Evaluation
- Stakeholder reporting

## Business Problem

SpaceX's ability to reuse the Falcon 9 first stage drastically reduces launch costs compared to competitors. Accurately predicting first stage landings empowers startups to bid competitively against SpaceX for rocket launches, leveraging data science insights and models.

## Objective

Utilize data science tools and machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of successful Falcon 9 first stage landings. This prediction directly influences launch cost estimates and informs strategic bidding decisions for competing startups.
