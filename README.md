# SpaceX Data Science Project 

## Introduction

SpaceX leads the commercial space industry by making space travel more affordable, thanks to its reusable Falcon 9 rockets. Priced at $62 million per launch, significantly less than competitors, SpaceXâ€™s cost savings come from reusing the first stage. This project involves predicting the likelihood of SpaceX reusing the first stage, using machine learning and public data, simulating the role of a data scientist at Space Y, a new competitor.


This project simulates real-life data science challenges, covering data collection, wrangling, exploratory analysis, visualization, model development, evaluation, and stakeholder reporting. As a Data Scientist for a startup competing with SpaceX, the goal is to predict the success of Falcon 9 first stage landings.

## Business Problem

SpaceX's ability to reuse the Falcon 9 first stage drastically reduces launch costs compared to competitors. Accurately predicting first stage landings empowers startups to bid competitively against SpaceX for rocket launches, leveraging data science insights and models.

## Objective

Utilize data science tools and machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of successful Falcon 9 first stage landings. This prediction directly influences launch cost estimates and informs strategic bidding decisions for competing startups.
